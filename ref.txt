Purpose of the Document This document defines the ATP software requirements assigned from the onboard train The ATP software described in this document is not only including the This document is the specification for the ATP software designers , and 1 . 2 . Field of Application This document is part of iTC R&D , and it concerns the 1 . 3 . Identification of the Last Requirement Defined The last requirement defined is the ATP-SwRS- 0 8 0 4 , 2 . SYSTEM CONTEXT 2 . 1 . Purpose The ATP software is the core component of the Carborne Controller , using hardware board resources to realize the period time control , and access external systems or data from other subsystems within the CC ; through from the rolling stock and internal or external systems data to according to the odometer and trackside beacon message , calculating the train's monitoring train speed , location and energy to avoid the train to according to the platform information , enabling to operate the train door generating vital reports and commands to external systems and the rolling stock 2 . 2 . Assumptions ATP software developers should be aware of the basic principles of urban The vital part of ATP software applies " Vital Coded Processor " The onboard ATP software running on CASCO's new 2 × 2 oo 2 . 3 . Application and Reference Documents 2 . 4 . Abbreviations and Defines Reference to [ APP 1 ] for abbreviations and defines . 2 . 5 . Conventions The organization of ATP software development shall follow the process of SIL The conventions of ARDL used for describing software requirements are shown as Use indentation to express hierarchy structure ; Use ( k ) after each variable to represent the value in Use " and " , " or " , " not " Use brackets to represent arrays ; Use uppercase to represent system constants . The description of common functions used in ARDL are shown as Table 3 . GENERAL CONSTRAINTS 3 . 1 . User Characteristics N / A 3 . 2 .

Production Constraints [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 0 0 3 ] ATP software shall use parameters come from iTC system data preparation for [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 0 0 4 ] For sub-system design constraints , it is not possible to establish more [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 0 0 5 ] For interface design constraints , ATP shall use FSFB 2 safety protocol [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 5 5 0 ] During the operation , the onboard ATP shall not response any request [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 4 9 8 ] The codes of the onboard ATP shall follow the [ REF 1 NOTES : For each vital variable encoded by the VCP tool , its higher [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 4 9 9 ] For VCP constraints , the onboard ATP importing data from non-vital devices [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 5 0 0 ] Each set of onboard ATP shall have two parts of programs , [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 5 0 1 ] The onboard ATP shall work on the VxWorks 5 . 5 operating [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 7 6 0 ] iCODER-VCP 1 and iCODER-VCP 2 shall be installed in two different computer [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 7 6 1 ] The number of global variables that need to be redundant coded in [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 7 6 2 ] The redundant code generation function can generate redundant code for functions which [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 7 6 3 ] The following four annotations of key words are supported : The function definition which noted by comment key word / * KWNOPARMF The function must be defined before it is firstly be called , The function cannot have parameters . Otherwise , give an error message Return statement cannot be used in this function . Otherwise , give Local variables cannot be used in this function . Otherwise , give The use restrictions for comment keyword / * KWADJMF * / are The module function which be noted must satisfy the restrictions of module The module function which be noted by keyword / * KWADJMF * / * KWADJMF * / can only be used to note module The total number of signatures which used in the module function noted This module function cannot use array . Otherwise , give an error This module function can only use once in the coding files . These fields annotated by keyword are only valid when we first encounter [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 7 6 4 ] For the system which using iCODER- 1 0 0 to achieve SIL [ iTC_CC_ATP-SwRS- 0 7 6 5 ] Header file’s nesting cannot exceed 1 0 layers .
